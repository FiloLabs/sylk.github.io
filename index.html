<h2>What?</h2>
<h4>Hey! This is Sylk. Now I bet you're wondering what the hay Sylk is. Sylk is a bot programmed by FiloLabs to auto-respond and entertain. For example, whenever you have do not disturb on, it will send a message to anyone trying to text you that you can't respond right now. It then puts them on an exclude list to prevent them from receiving that message again until you turn do not disturb off and back on again. You can also set it up to recognize when you're sleeping, and use that as your status instead. Now for the "entertain" part. Sylk is rapidly gaining a large amount of new commands for entertainment. #joke, #whosjoe, and more are some good examples.</h4>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<h4>Good question. As stated above, Sylk can auto-respond when you're away - without spamming them every time you send a message. The other benefit of Sylk is that it works with your existing messages app. This isn't a third party piece o' poop messaging app with a few added features.
